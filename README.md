# 🧪 Interactive 3D Atom & Periodic Table Visualizer

**A fully interactive chemistry visualization tool built using C/C++, OpenGL, and GLUT.**
Explore the entire **118-element periodic table** and view dynamically animated **3D atomic models** with orbiting electrons, realistic nuclei, and educational overlays. Includes **lanthanide & actinide separation**, **DDA line-drawing implementation**, and smooth 2D/3D transitions.

Perfect for computer graphics learning, chemistry education, and academic demonstrations.
